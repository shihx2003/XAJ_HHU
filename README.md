# XAJ_HHU
**Source code of Xinanjiang Model from Hohai University**

The Xinanjiang model is available with test data for download from the [**College of Hydrology and Water Resources**](https://shxy.hhu.edu.cn/) at Hohai University. You can access the model and documentation on the [Xinanjiang Model page](https://shxy.hhu.edu.cn/research/xaj).

The original version of the model was written in Python and then packaged into an executable file using PyInstaller. 

In this project, the executable was unpacked using `pyinstxtractor.py` to extract the `.pyc` files. These `.pyc` files were then decompiled using [PyLingual](https://pylingual.io/).

After extraction and decompilation, the model has been thoroughly tested and verified. The execution results from the decompiled Python code match the original results produced by the `.exe` version, confirming the accuracy and integrity of the process.
